## Scenario

_The small Software Development Company (SDC) has found a possible market niche for giving out a simple to deploy web-server. SDC aims to redistribute this server on a wide range of Internet Of Things (IOT) to present information from sensors etc. SDC wants an easy to deploy java-web-server that can be deployed on many different devices and therefore that can attract attention of a wide range of IOT developers. IOT-developers want minimal configuration as well as easy integration and adaptation of the web-server. End-customers want easy access and absolute security. The SDC management has found an open source abandonware software called “My web server”. It is your job as SDC employee(s) to evaluate the current state of “My web server”. SDC needs to know if the abandoned software fulfills the requirements as stated in the requirement document. Your budget is one man-week times the number of students. SDC management want a strategy, plan, test-cases as well as a test-report by the 23 December._

## Todo: list

* Write a test-strategy for the application.
* Write a test-plan for the application for current iteration
* Write manual test cases for the application
* Execute the test-plan (test the software)
* Report the result of testing in a test report.

## Deliverables

Hand in your strategy, test-plan, test-cases and test-report as and upload that into the Peer Review system before the deadline.

### Important notes on how to prepare and handin the artifacts:
* The strategy, test-plan, test-cases and test-report should be written as a single MarkDown formatted (.md) file
* The document should be anonymous, no names or traces of who you are should be in the document. Instead use role-names like “test-lead”, “scrum-master” or “product-owner”. The document and other text are not anonymous to course management.
* All students in the group should upload the exact same document, please make sure that if you update the document and resubmit that all students update it.
* The document or parts of it may not be shared between groups.
* Read the review task in order to find out more about how to write a successful document.
