### Goals

* Stakeholders and testing goals

### Resources/Budget

* Time ( 2 x 40 hours )

  * Static and dynamic
* Prioritization
  * Any part of system more important?
  * What part is implemented?
* What should be regressed?
  * What failed last iteration
  * What code components has been updated
  * Traceability of test result

How should we test?

* Automation
* Manual
* Exploratory?
* Beta?
* Customer?

Test-levels

* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Manual tests
* Acceptance tests

How do we judge the test-results to be ok or not ok?

What actions should happen if it is not ok?

* Depends on the stakeholders goals
  * High code coverage?
* Depends on the what we intend to do next iteration
  * Main success scenarios to succeed?

Who is responsible?

* Who implements that test?
* Who runs that test?
* Who has vital information?
* Who uses the result?
